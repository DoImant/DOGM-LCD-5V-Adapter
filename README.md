# 5V Adapter for the DOGMxxxxA Carrier Board.

This board is an adapter with which the 3.3V LCD-DOGMxxxx-A adapter board can also be operated with 5V (e.g. Arduino Nano/Uno).
Because the data flow is only unidirectional to the display, a 74LVC245A octal bus transceiver IC could be used as a level converter.
